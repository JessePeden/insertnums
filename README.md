# insertnums README

This is the README for my extension "insertnums".

The extension helps to insert (consecutive) numbers across multiple selections 
or modifies the selections contents with expressions. Huge configurability.

This extension is mainly a copy of the wonderful sublimetext extension from
James Books (https://github.com/jbrooksuk/InsertNums).
During my usage of Sublimetext I recognized the wonderful features and options
I could use with this extension. Unfortunately, it is written in Python and
I never found a similar extension for Visual Studio Code.
So I tried to rewrite the source code in Javascript and currently, I have
an alpha version - not all feature are implemented but I will update the next
versions soon.

## Features

To read the features, please look at the original extension 
[here](https://github.com/jbrooksuk/InsertNums).

If I have the time, I will write more in the future.

## Release Notes

All release notes are in the Changelog file

**Enjoy!**
